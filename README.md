### Card Compendium
This is a fictional project, with the idea of creating a card game player that can run different rule-sets such as _poker_, _hearts_, or _solitaire_.

This project would need to accomplish 3 important functions:
1. The program would need to take input from the player on what ruleset to use
2. The program would need to be able to play a game without mixing the rules up
3. The game would need to be able to save and restore games for the longer games

While this is fairly simple for a "dream" project, it provides a nice benchmark
for how well I've learned python and could be used to test my abilities. Ideally
making a project like this would be initially easy but creating various specific
rulesets for obscure or complex games like bridge would help test my abilities.
